  This study investigates the impact of tourism experiences on Chinese consumers' online
  shopping practices using household-level data from the China Household Finance Survey.
  Amid rapid technological advancement and the expanding digital economy, understanding
  how consumption patterns evolve is crucial, particularly in developing economies
  promoting domestic tourism demand. The results provide the first empirical evidence
  demonstrating a significant positive effect of tourism experience on subsequent online
  shopping expenditure. This finding remains robust to potential endogeneity concerns
  addressed through the instrumental variable method and a series of robustness tests.
  Employing the Technology Acceptance Model, I further explore the mechanism, identifying
  perceived security as a key mediatorâ€”more critical for driving third-party payment
  adoption than perceived convenience. These results underscore the significant influence
  of tourism on stimulating online consumer activity within the digital ecosystem and
  highlight the pivotal importance of perceived security in facilitating payment method
  adoption in developing countries. (JEL classification: D12; L83; O33)
